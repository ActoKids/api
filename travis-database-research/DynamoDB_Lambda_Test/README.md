Demo of DynamoDB and Lambda:

This was almost all done in the AWS web console so the Lambda files here are only copies of the code stored in AWS but shown here for Toddy to view.  The index.html page is my local app used for showing the demo.  I used two Lambda functions, one DynamoDB talble, API Gateway, and of course in my index.html is html and javascript.  This demo actually works great unlike my DocumentDB demo.  Note, I did not include my endpoints for the repo because they are open but have them stored locally for the demo.
